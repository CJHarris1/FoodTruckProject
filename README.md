# Food Truck Project

## Description
This is my second Java project at Skill Distillery Boot Camp. This project was about creating an app to enter in information about a food truck you visited, enter in the name, food type, and your personal rating for the truck. Hitting run on the application will launch into an option to add up to 5 food trucks. You can quit entering truck information by following the prompt and typing 'quit' instead of a truck name. After entering truck information you will be shown a menu for 4 options. You can view all the trucks and their information, view the average rating for all the trucks that have been entered, or view the top rated food truck. The last option is to quit and the program will end.

## Lessons Learned
I learned a lot from this project. This was my first time using 2 separate classes and using encapsulation to hide private data. I was able to utilize a constructor method, getters, setters and a toString method to display all of the information from a private field. I learned the strengths of a String Builder and how to clear that data to use one instances created of the String Builder in multiple locations in the program. We were instructed to no longer use static for our methods and how to create and instance of the class to run the program.
